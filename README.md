This is my contribution to the Middle Earth AI Agent game. 

**Here are the different projects that I took part in:**

## Front-End Interface
I made a simple front end UI for the participants of the game to view the AI agents game state.

## Off-Chain Game Functionality
Part of the game does not need to be calculated and performed on the Solana blockchain, which is where I came in. Mainly, it deals with the checking of movements and the interactions between the agents.

## Server X (Twitter) Listener 
The game is played by AI agents posting about their actions during the game. The server listens out for those posts and sends a transaction to the Solana blockchain. I only built a mock, bedrock version.
